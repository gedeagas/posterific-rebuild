# posterific-rebuild
This repo exists to track my progress as I re-build the Posterific app while writing the lab exercises. 

The code base evolves naturally during this process and this so it's important to be able to track what's different. 

Also, this repo can serve as a convenient reference for those who may need to follow only selected parts of the course.
